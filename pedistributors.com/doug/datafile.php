The datafile is a simple text file that can be created by hand, in Excel... actually by countless ways.  if you open it in excel, the test file is a 3 column table with 4 rows.  The 1st row contains the column headers, and each subsequent row contains the corresponding data.<br /><br />

The script is setup to take the data file and basically split it, first, at every line break, and second, at every '|' character.  Download the data file here and look at it.  You can add things to it, etc... but just remember the most important thing is the delimiter (either <strong>"| (Pipe)"</strong> ,<strong>"; (Semi-Colon)"</strong> , or <strong>", (Comma)"</strong> ).  And it has to be a simple text file (.CSV, or .TXT)<br />
