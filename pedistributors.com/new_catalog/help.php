          You can click on the CONTENTS heading that is located in the grey bar 
          menu that is located on every page. Once you are directed to the Table 
          of Contents spread, click on the Table of Contents page to see a larger 
          view of it. You can now click on each section to be taken to the fist 
          page of that section automatically. (3) By using the arrow buttons that 
          are located at the top of each spread page you can move forward and 
          back by one spread at a time. (4) By using the arrow buttons that are 
          located at the top of each larger view page you can move forward and 
          back by one page at a time. (5) You can click on the INDEX heading that 
          is located in the grey bar menu that is located on every page. Once 
          you are directed to the index spread, click on any of the index pages 
          to see a larger view of it. You can now look up a specific product to 
          see what page number those products can be found on.</font></p>
