<description>Stage 1 Boost Cooler™
					

					
The gasoline Stage 1 Boost Cooler™ kit is available for forced
induction applications that are either fuel injected or carbureted.
Operation is very simple: the system starts injecting when the boost
switch reaches the user-adjustable point and it injects a fixed amount
of fluid through the nozzle until the switch opens again. This makes it
a good choice for low to medium boost setups looking for an octane
enhancement and cooler intake charge. Activation can also be set up
through any other user-chosen switch, such as a full throttle switch,
etc. Now with Lifetime Warranty - please see details.
 
Kit includes:

•	SHO (Special High Output) Pump
•	3 Quart Reservoir 
•	2 Nozzles To Cover a Wide Range of Horsepower
•	Required Hardware Needed For Installation
•	Comprehensive Instructions</description>

<description>Stage 1 Boost Cooler NA™
					

					

The gasoline Stage 1 Boost Cooler NA™ kit is available for naturally
aspirated applications that don't utilize a MAF sensor. Operation is
very simple, the system starts injecting when the vacuum switch reaches
the user-adjustable point and it injects a fixed amount of fluid
through the nozzle until the switch opens again. This makes it a good
choice for naturally aspirated cars looking for an octane enhancement
and cooler intake charge. Activation can also be set up through any
other user-chosen switch, such as a full throttle switch, etc. 

*Note - Safe Injection can not be used with Stage 1 Systems *</description>

<title>Snow Performance 49005 Diesel Stage 3 MPG-MAX Boost Cooler</title>
<g:brand>Snow Performance</g:brand>
<g:condition>new</g:condition>
<description>Diesel Stage 3 MPG-MAX™ Boost Cooler
					

					
New from Snow Performance is the only system proven to increase fuel
economy in all load states – empty or while towing. Special mapping and
the most sophisticated 2d digital controller available result in 1-3
MPG increases! The MPG-MAX™ system does not require a sustained high
load state in order to provide maximum fuel economy gains. The MPG-MAX™
system uses a new injection management controller that allows for a
small, steady spray of watermethanol to be injected across the entire
power curve, at anything over normal cruising boost. This provides an
increase in combustion efficiency which provides more power without
injecting more diesel fuel. This increase in efficiency translates into
an increase in fuel economy. Typical fuel economy increases are 10-15
or 1-3 MPG. 

The MPG-MAX™ system has a secondary output that is used to activate a
Power Mode. The more sophisticated microprocessor introduces a
independently mapped second stage of injection. A larger nozzle is used
to inject more fluid to make more power. The Power Mode activation
point is adjustable for best performance. The net effect is smooth
power in all engine load states with no combustion quench resulting in
a true turn-on-and-forget system. 

It also now has a brighter Green LCD screen that displays boost, EGTs,
and injection pump output. This means a savings of 200-300 in gauges
you don’t have to buy.

•	Will not adversely affect particulate matter filter like most other power adders
•	Doesn’t leave a “signature” on vehicles computer so warranty isn’t jeopardized
•	Comes complete with large 7 gal. reservoir for a truly complete system
•	The most advanced system on the market – true 2d mapping and 2 nozzles controlled independently for smooth power – always
•	The only system proven to improve fuel economy
•	Provides better fuel economy (1-3 MPG), more power (50-100 HP), and lower EGTs (150 degrees-300 degrees F)
•	Dash mounted module – displays real time – no need for gauges

Diesel Stage 3 MPG-MAX Boost Cooler upgrades are now available for
customers with existing systems. The 7 Gallon Reservoir (40016) is
recommended if a larger reservoir isn't already being used. Please see
product listing (60005) and pricing below. 

*Note - MPG MAX Systems can not be used with the HDHO Pump *</description>

<g:brand>Snow Performance</g:brand>
<g:condition>new</g:condition>
<description>Stage 2 Boost Cooler™
					


					
This kit uses manifold boost pressure to determine when and how much
fluid to inject. Proportionally injecting according to boost pressure
gives the most accurate delivery of water-methanol and allows the most
cooling and performance improvement over the widest range. More power
and driveability is the result. It can be used on any forced induction
engine: carbureted, fuel injected, turbocharged, positive displacement
or centrifugal blowers. The most suitable are the centrifugal
supercharged and turbocharged engines, as they build boost is a more
progressive manner concerning water-methanol injection. The positive
displacement blower engines will work, but it might take more work to
dial in the delivery. For higher boost applications (over 25psi), the
controller can be upgraded to our VC100 unit. Now with Lifetime
Warranty - please see details.

•	SHO (Special High Output) Pump

<description>20020 MC DOM fits Dominator Apps
	
Stage 2 Boost Cooler™ Muscle Car NA
					

					
Run 11:1 to 13:1 compression ratio (or more) on pump gas!! Increase
your pump gas octane by 20-25 points and make more power. More power
and efficiency with cooler running for your naturally aspirated V8
Muscle Car.


This kit uses a progressive controller that proportionally injects more
or less according to manifold vacuum. Start and full points are
adjustable for engagement and delivery curve, to match what the engine
requires. High compression modified engines can gain performance
through cooler intake charges and the large increase in octane and
detonation suppression. It can also be geared towards fuel economy and
using lower grades of gasoline. Comes with one or two 4150-style 1"
Carburetor spacer plate(s) or a Dominator carburetor spacer plate
threaded for Snow Performance injection nozzles, and a solenoid to
prevent vacuum siphoning. 

Kit includes:

•	SHO (Special High Output) Pump
•	One or two 1" Carb Spacer Plates (4150 Style) or one Dominator Carb Spacer Plate
•	Solenoid Valve to prevent Siphoning
•	3 Quart Reservoir 
•	Adjustable Variable Controller
•	2 or 4 Nozzles To Cover a Wide Range of Horsepower
•	All Required Hardware Needed For Installation
•	Comprehensive Instructions</description>
