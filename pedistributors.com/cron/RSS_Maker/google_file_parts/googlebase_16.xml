Dual-Friction pressure plates feature their patented centrifugal weight 
system (where applicable) and specialized machining processes to provide
 a performance clutch that offers exceptional street characteristics, 
while offering outstanding holding-capacity and durability. Furthermore,
 the Centerforce Dual-Friction disc has a full facing on the pressure 
plate side for drivability and longevity, while a carbon composite puc 
style (segmented) facing is used on the flywheel side for a positive 
engagement and increased holding-capacity.  Dual Friction is engineered 
for those who are looking for the ultimate in streetstrip holding power
 and performance without sacrificing pedal effort and driver control. 
While the Dual Friction has been engineered primarily as a street clutch
 it can be used in mild competition applications.

The DFX line is the latest series of performance

their competition-proven clutch package for select import and domestic 
applications.  This new DFX series is engineered for competition 
standards of quality and craftsmanship. The DFX series is aimed at 
high-end applications that continually demand increased integrity and 
holding-capacity.  DFX scores big, not only with holding-capacity and 
strength, but also provides some of the best drivability from a 
race-inspired clutch.  DFX retains an easy pedal effort, thanks to 
Centerforces patented ball bearing actuated diaphragm, for smooth 
engagements without detriment to the vehicles release components.  The 
Centerforce DFX performance clutch system utilizes Nodular Iron pressure
 plate rings and reinforcements designed to help prevent drive strap 
breakage and safety. The DFX series allows the end user to tailor the 
performance and style of driving with different choices of clutches and 
clutch discs: From streetstrip to full-on drag racing capability.

The DFX line is the latest series of performance 
clutches from Centerforce.  Centerforce is proud to announce DFX as 
their competition-proven clutch package for select import and domestic 
applications.  This new DFX series is engineered for competition 
standards of quality and craftsmanship. The DFX series is aimed at 
high-end applications that continually demand increased integrity and 
holding-capacity.  DFX scores big, not only with holding-capacity and 
strength, but also provides some of the best drivability from a 
race-inspired clutch.  DFX retains an easy pedal effort, thanks to 
Centerforces patented ball bearing actuated diaphragm, for smooth 
engagements without detriment to the vehicles release components.  The 
Centerforce DFX performance clutch system utilizes Nodular Iron pressure
 plate rings and reinforcements designed to help prevent drive strap 
breakage and safety. The DFX series allows the end user to tailor the 
performance and style of driving with different choices of clutches and 
clutch discs: From streetstrip to full-on drag racing capability.</description>

CENTERFORCE BILLET ALUMINUM FLYWHEEL



Centerforce manufactures the best in SFI approved 
performance flywheels by using high-strength billets, not castings.  
Centerforce flywheel part numbers with a 700 prefix are made from 
billet steel and match closely to the original equipment flywheel 
weight.  Centerforce 800 and 900 flywheel part number prefixes 
designate specially made flywheels from aircraft grade billet aluminum 
for light weight (low inertia).   Centerforce aluminum flywheels also 
feature mechanically retained starter ring gears as well as replaceable 
steel friction surfaces that have been heat-treated for abrasion 
resistance and long life.   All Centerforce flywheels are CADCAM 
designed and then CNC machined to strict tolerances for perfect fitment 
and hassle-free, bolt-in performance.   Consult your Centerforce catalog
 or web site for the latest in performance flywheel applications!
