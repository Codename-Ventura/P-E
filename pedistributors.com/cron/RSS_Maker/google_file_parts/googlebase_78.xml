<title>Turbo Start S16VL 16V Lightweight Racing Battery</title>
<g:brand>Turbo Start</g:brand>
<g:condition>new</g:condition>
<description>At only 32 pounds, TurboStart's light weight 16 volt battery is the 
lightest in the industry. You drop 25 of the weight while still 
maintaining cranking power. It puts out 450 cold cranking amps at 0 degreesF, 
and 550 cranking amps at 32 degreesF. Reserve capacity is 50 minutes. It is 
perfect for low amp draw and alternator applications. 
	


The sealed TurboStart AGM Series 16 volt lightweight battery (part  
S16L) utilizes the latest state of the art AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) 
separator technology just as the original. 

	

Because they can't leak, even if the container is damaged, we're able
 to ship our TurboStart AGM Series types fully charged so the battery is
 ready to go when you get it. 

	

The unique valve regulated design ensures that each cell operates at a
 slight positive pressure allowing the hydrogen and oxygen gas 
recombination process to occur within the battery which virtually 
eliminates on - charge gassing. No more maintenance and no more acid 
mess! 

	

The S16VL maintenance free 16 volt battery is leakproof and 
spillproof and has a low profile "Bolt-in" terminal design for lug style
 terminal hook ups. 

	

The TurboStart AGM Series 16 volt charger (part  AGM25A19V) is fully
 automatic with a 25 amp output and has been upgraded over the standard 
TurboStart 16 volt charger to be able to charge either AGM or flooded 16
 volt types. A charger curcuit board chip is available for the AGM 
Series 16 volt battery to allow existing TurboStart 16 volt users to 
upgrade their standard TurboStart charger to the new AGM Series charger 
design. Our 16VRES step down voltage reducer is also available for use 
with the AGM Series 16 volt battery which allows the racer to run 14 
volts to desired components.

<title>Turbo Start 16VRES Voltage Step Down</title>
<g:brand>Turbo Start</g:brand>
<g:condition>new</g:condition>
<description>The Step Down Voltage Resistor (Part  16VRES) is used with the 2 
post 16V24 or the S16V AGM Series 16 volt battery. The 16VRES in-line 
resistor allows you to cut down the voltage by 2.5 volts to desired 
accessories (16.8 volts - 2.5 volts  14.3 volts) which will put the 
desired accessory's operating voltage within the output range on today's
 12 volt alternator equipped systems. It will carry 15 amps continuous 
or 100 amps peak for 60 seconds and should be wired in-line to the hot 
wire of the desired component(s). The resistor is not necessary when 
using the 3post 16V324 battery, the Boost Box, and the 12 volt 
alternator, as those components which the racer does not want to run on 
16 volts can be connected to the 12 volt post. 


		When running the 16V24 or S16A AGM Series two post systems, we 
recommend that you resistor any components using the step-down voltage 
resistor (part 16VRES) if the component is not listed as 16 volt 
compatible by its manufacturer. We recommend that wiring in the car be 
no smaller than 16 gauge wire. Should you have a concern regarding wire 
size to a component, that component should be resistored.


		**** The STEP DOWN RESISTOR (PART  16VRES) is wired IN-LINE on the 
hot wire of the component(s) to be resistored. The unit is not to be 
grounded. The black wire is NOT a ground. We strongly suggest that if 
you are unsure as to whether a certain component is compatible with 16 
volts, that you contact the manufacturer of that product for their 
professional opinion.</description>

<title>Turbo Start S16V 16V Performance Battery</title>
<g:brand>Turbo Start</g:brand>
<g:condition>new</g:condition>
<description>The sealed TurboStart® AGM Series 16 volt battery (part  S16V) 
utilizes the latest state of the art AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) separator
 technology. Because they can't leak, even if the container is damaged, 
we're able to ship our TurboStart® AGM Series types fully charged so the
 battery is ready to go when you get it.


The unique valve regulated design ensures that each cell operates at a
 slight positive pressure allowing the hydrogen and oxygen gas 
recombination process to occur within the battery which virtually 
eliminates on - charge gassing. No more maintenance and no more acid 
mess!


The S16V maintenance free 16 volt battery is leakproof and spillproof
 and has a low profile, 38", "Bolt-in" terminal design for lug style 
terminal hook ups.


The TurboStart® AGM Series 16 volt charger (part  AGM25A19V) is 
fully automatic with a 25 amp 19volt output and has been upgraded over 
the standard TurboStart® 16 volt charger to be able to charge either AGM
 or flooded 16 volt types. A charger curcuit board chip is available for
 the original flooded series 16 volt chargers to allow existing 
TurboStart® 16 volt users to upgrade their charger to charge the new AGM
 series batteries. Our 16VRES step down voltage reducer is also 
available for use with the AGM Series 16 volt battery which allows the 
racer to run 14 volts to desired components.


Racers in all forms of motorsports have made the switch to 16 volts. 
TurboStart® is the innovator of the 16 volt concept to racing, and Axion
 Power?International Inc. is proud of the fact that more than 95 of the
 competitors in the National Hot Rod Association's (NHRA) professional 
drag racing class of Pro Stock and the International Hot Rod 
Association's (IHRA) professional classes of Pro Stock and Pro Modified 
have made the switch to the TurboStart® 16 volt system. The patented 
TurboStart® 16 volt system is also widely used in circle track racing 
including such sanctions as NASCAR, Busch Grand National and ASA.


The secret behind 16 volts is the performance advantage gained from 
the hotter spark produced by the higher voltage. Additional 16 volt 
benefits include a faster spinning starter and higher volume flow from 
electric water pumps and fuel pumps.


The excessive vibrations and electrical demands that racing puts on a
 battery are a true test of its durability. We take what we learn at the
 racetrack and apply that knowledge to every TurboStart® battery we 
build. Many of the top race car engine and chassis builders now 
recommend using the TurboStart® 16 volt racing battery over a 
conventional 12 volt battery.
